The solution is to always remove observers in the dealloc method of the observer object.  Additionally, using `-removeObserver:forKeyPath:` within the observed object's `-dealloc` method as a safeguard can mitigate potential issues. 
```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... KVO observation logic ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedProperty"];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```
Ensure that `self` is used as the observer and `@"observedProperty"` is the correct keypath. Consider using blocks for cleaner KVO management in modern Objective-C development.
