In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  If an observer is not removed properly when the observed object is deallocated, a crash can occur. This is because the observer might try to access the deallocated object, leading to a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  This is particularly problematic in situations with complex object graphs or when dealing with asynchronous operations.
